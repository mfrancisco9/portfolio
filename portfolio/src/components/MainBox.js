                <p>I am a Chicago-based full stack web developer and a graduate of Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp with a focus on the MERN stack. I'm interested in projects related to music, language, and food and drink. <br/> <br />

                I studied Global Development and Arabic at Indiana University and afterwards moved to Saudi Arabia and worked as an educator. Up until recently I've worked in specialty coffee roasting & quality control at Intelligentsia in Chicago. After teaching myself basic HTML/CSS/Javascript, I decided I wanted to pursue coding full time.
